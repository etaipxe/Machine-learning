# **Machine Learning-Assisted Investigation of Strain Effects on Clustered Anti-Perovskite Solid-State Electrolytes: A Case of Study about Li₃OBH₄ Using DFT Calculations**

This repository provides the open-source data and code accompanying the research article titled "Machine Learning-Assisted Investigation of Strain Effects on Clustered Anti-Perovskite Solid-State Electrolytes: A Case of Study about Li₃OBH₄ Using DFT Calculations."

## **Overview**
In this project, we combine machine learning models with Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) simulations to systematically investigate the response of Li₃OBH₄ under various strain conditions. By leveraging machine learning to predict migration energy barriers, we gain deeper insights into its behavior under realistic strain scenarios. Adjusting strain to modulate migration energy barriers significantly enhances lithium-ion conductivity, providing critical theoretical guidance for the design and optimization of advanced solid-state electrolytes for lithium batteries.
